**ctalign** allows to perform an automatic alignment of stacks of images.

It can be used between others to:

* Align tomography projections (in order to improve the quality of the 
subsequent reconstruction).

*  Align spectroscopy images: images taken at different light energies.

It is used at BL09 of the ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron.
