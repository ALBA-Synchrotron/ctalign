**ctalign** allows to perform an automatic alignment of an image stack.

It can be used among others to:

* Align tomography projections (in order to improve the quality of the 
subsequent reconstruction).

* Align spectroscopy images: images taken at different light energies.

It is used at BL09 of the ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron.
